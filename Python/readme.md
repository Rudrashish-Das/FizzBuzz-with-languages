# Compile & Execute

I have used the ***Python 3.10.4*** interpreter for my tests.

To **execute**, run
>python3 main.py 1 1024

This will run the program for the range 1 to 1024. Alternatively you can simply write a single parameter which will run the program from 1 to whatever range specified.

>_***Warning:*** Running the code without any parameters might result in a crash as it attempts to run the program in the range **1 to sys.maxsize.**_
